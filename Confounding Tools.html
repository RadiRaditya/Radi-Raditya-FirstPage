    <b>ASSIGNMENT I: Confounding Tools</b>

    <p>Brief: Design a 24” × 36” digital poster about your life under COVID 19 without using software explicitly intended for design.</p>
    <p>I spent a lot of my time playing Animal Crossing and walking around my neighborhood during Covid. Animal Crossing is a simulation game where the player is going to a secluded island to build their life there. The seasons and time in the game are following the apparent time zone in real life, which makes this game interesting and frustrating at the same time. During covid, where many shops are closed, this game was my exit from reality. It almost felt like my mini digital vacation. My initial idea was to create that irony. As I progressed with my exploration, I started to be more abstract in painting my canvas with my experiences of covid in mind.</p>
    <p>For the beginning part of covid, everything felt so good. I was looking forward to starting school in the Fall and recently resigned from the job that I hated. Plus, the world seems frozen for a moment. It was like a beautiful sunset; it was pretty enough to make you forget about the long dark night that was about to come. Days after days started to feel the same, and the seasons started to get colder. The warm peaceful feelings started to be replaced by the cold lonely days. The idea of time was distorted, it felt long but short at the same time. The repetition of mundane activity and the quietness forced me to appreciate the little things around me, to find joy in simplicity. Now, when I look back and look at the bigger picture, those little experiences are beauty in disguise.</p>
