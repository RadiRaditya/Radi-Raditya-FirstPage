    <p>This project is based on myself reflection journey. As a person who is dealing with depression and anxiety, I tend to over think every little details of my life. I used to carry those excessive thoughts with me, dragging it along everywhere I go. I started journaling because I could not bear those excessive thought anymore. I often heard journaling is an effective way to reflect on ourselves, but the act of journaling is not sustainable, it is hard to maintain. Many people have a difficult time to keep up with the journal, almost like it was a chore.</p>
    <p>My first idea was to make an image book to reflect of my journal. I tried to be consistent writing about my day and associate it with colors, object or situation that perfectly illustrate my feeling. That act of creating a mental image in trying to explain my feeling is the key to my idea. I found it easier to express my feeling through colors, doodling, or even collages. It is my passion to create beautiful things and reflecting on myself at the same time. On that moment, the idea to combine journaling and creating art came from and unpack kit was born.</p>
